# Isomorphic JavaScript with React & Node

## What is Isomorphic JavaScript ?

Shared JavaScript that runs on both the client & server.

## What does Isomorphic JS solve?
JavaScript driven MVCs can take a second or two to load content on the page for users. This makes for a bad user experience.

Benefits:
* better overall user experience
* search engine indexable
* easier code maintenance
* free progressive enhancements

## Install Instructions

If you would like to download the code and try it for yourself:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:HelloClicky/helloClicky.git`
2. Install packages: `npm install`
3. Launch: `node server.js`
4. Visit in your browser at: `http://localhost:4444`
5. To see serverside rendering, comment out main.js from the /views/index.ejs file. This will show what is rendered purely from the server side.
